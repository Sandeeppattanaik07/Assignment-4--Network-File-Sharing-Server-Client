# Assignment-4-Network-File-Sharing-Server-Client
A C++ project implementing a secure client-server file sharing system on Linux using socket programming, authentication, and encryption for reliable data transfer.
Project Title

Network File Sharing Application (Server & Client Model)

Objective

The main goal of this project is to build a secure and efficient file sharing system using C++ and Linux socket programming. The application follows a client–server model where multiple clients can connect to a central server to exchange files safely over a network.

Project Description

This project demonstrates how a client and server can communicate over a TCP connection in a Linux environment. The server manages a shared directory and handles multiple client requests, while the clients can upload, download, or view files available on the server. To ensure security, the system includes a simple authentication process and uses data encryption so that files transferred across the network remain protected.

The project uses Linux System Programming (LSP) concepts such as socket creation, binding, listening, and data streaming. It helps understand how real-world file transfer applications work under the hood, providing hands-on experience with low-level networking and system calls.

Tools & Technologies Used:-

1. Programming Language: C++

2. Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu or Fedora recommended)

3. Networking Protocol: TCP/IP sockets

4. Security: Basic authentication and encryption (e.g., XOR or AES)

5. Version Control: Git & GitHub

6. Editor/Compiler: Visual Studio Code with GCC

Key Features:-

1. Supports multiple client connections simultaneously

2. Allows file upload and download between client and server

3. Includes user authentication for secure access

4. Encrypts data during transfer for privacy

5. Implements proper error handling and logging

Learning Outcomes:-

Through this project, I gained practical knowledge of Linux system calls, socket programming, and client-server communication. I also learned how to apply encryption and authentication techniques to secure data transfers and how to manage a professional project repository using GitHub.
